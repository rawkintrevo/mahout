# New Website Released

We've launced a new website, (a YUUUGE special thanks to David Miller from [StartBootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com)).

It looks great but there's lots to do as we migrate and clean up content from the old site. If you see anything broken, 
please let us know via either:
- drop a lint to dev@mahout.apache.org
- fix it yourself and [open a PR](/developers/githubPRs)!
